- Radio button group component `AntdRadioGroup`
  - New feature parameter `block` has been added to control the radio buttons to fill the parent container completely [@CNFeffery](https://github.com/CNFeffery) 
- Floating button group `AntdFloatButtonGroup`
  - New feature parameter `placement` has been added to control the direction of the menu mode expansion [@CNFeffery](https://github.com/CNFeffery) 
- Table component `AntdTable`
  - The parameter `columns` has a new sub-parameter `minWidth`, which can restrict the minimum width of the field when `tableLayout='auto'` [@CNFeffery](https://github.com/CNFeffery) 
- New built-in module `_icons`
  - You can obtain all the icon type names built into `AntdIcon` by using `from feffery_antd_components._icons import all_icons` [@CNFeffery](https://github.com/CNFeffery) 

## Changes

- The sub-parameter `fixed` of the `AntdTable` parameter `columns` now supports `bool` type input, and setting it to `True` is equivalent to freezing the column on the left [@CNFeffery](https://github.com/CNFeffery) 
- The sub-parameter `label` of the `AntdSegmented` parameter `options` is no longer required to be set [@CNFeffery](https://github.com/CNFeffery)
